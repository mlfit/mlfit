Description: The Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) algorithm operates on count data. 
    This package offers implementations for several algorithms that extend this to 
    nested structures: 'parent' and 'child' items for both of which constraints can be provided.
    The fitting algorithms include Iterative Proportional Updating <https://trid.trb.org/view/881554>,
    Hierarchical IPF <doi:10.3929/ethz-a-006620748>, Entropy Optimization <https://trid.trb.org/view/881144>,
    and Generalized Raking <doi:10.2307/2290793>. Additionally, a number of replication methods
    is also provided such as 'Truncate, replicate, sample' <doi:10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2013.03.004>.
